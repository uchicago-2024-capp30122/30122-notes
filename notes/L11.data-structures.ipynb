    "# Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a mistake to think of data structures as *inventions* of computer science.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we need stacks, queues, and trees is that they mimic the way we already think about the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw that decision trees model a decision-making process not unlike ones we use in our daily lives.\n",
    "The shoes you have on are a function of the weather, occasion, and several other factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "But more generally, trees give us a way to represent hierarchical relationships.\n",
    "These occur when we're talking about genealogy, organizational structure, file systems, \n",
    "parsing languages like HTML, and countless other cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we'll take a look at data structures, and discuss where they might be useful.\n",
    "\n",

    "* Arrays\n",
    "* Linked Lists\n",
    "* Hash Tables\n",

    "## Lists vs. Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays are collections of items that are stored in contiguous memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does Python's list work?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a new list, Python allocates a block of memory that is large enough to hold the list (and then some).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you add an item to the list, Python checks to see if there is enough space in the block of memory.  If there isn't, Python allocates a new block of memory that is larger than the previous one, copies the contents of the old block into the new block, and then adds the new item to the new block.\n",
    "\n",
    "How fast are lists (in terms of time complexity)?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Insertion? At beginning? End?\n",
    "* Deletion?\n",
    "* Lookup of Nth item?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contiguous Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "There are additional advantages to having data stored in truly contiguous memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Python's implementation of a list uses a hybrid approach, Python does provide an `array` module that lets you define arrays of contiguous memory. It is difficult to use, and requires careful attention to type safety in a way normal Python code does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does however form the basis for NumPy's types an in turn pandas, and other tools rely heavily on contiguous memory.\n",
    "This is why applying a function across a DataFrame can be much faster than iterating one item at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linked Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Linked lists are collections of items that are stored in non-contiguous memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each item in the list contains a pointer to the next item in the list."

    "<blockquote>\n",
    "This module provides an implementation of the heap queue algorithm, also known as the priority queue algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heaps are binary trees for which every parent node has a value less than or equal to any of its children. This implementation uses arrays for which `heap[k] <= heap[2*k+1] and heap[k] <= heap[2*k+2]` for all `k`, counting elements from zero. For the sake of comparison, non-existing elements are considered to be infinite. The interesting property of a heap is that its smallest element is always the root, `heap[0]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API below differs from textbook heap algorithms in two aspects: (a) We use zero-based indexing. This makes the relationship between the index for a node and the indexes for its children slightly less obvious, but is more suitable since Python uses zero-based indexing. (b) Our pop method returns the smallest item, not the largest (called a “min heap” in textbooks; a “max heap” is more common in texts because of its suitability for in-place sorting).\n",
    "\n",
    "These two make it possible to view the heap as a regular Python list without surprises: heap[0] is the smallest item, and heap.sort() maintains the heap invariant!\n",
