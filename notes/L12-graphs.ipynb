        "* **Node**: A single entity in a graph.  Nodes may have arbitrary attributes such as name, color, size, etc. Nodes are typically represented as circles when drawing a graph.\n",
        "* **Edge**: A connection between two nodes.  Edges may have weight, direction, or other attributes.  Edges are typically represented as lines when drawing a graph, and arrows for a directed graph.\n",
        "* **Directed Graph** or **Digraph**: A graph where edges have a direction.  For example, a graph of social media users where each edge represents a follow relationship would be a directed graph.  The direction of the edge would be from the user who is following to the user who is being followed.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Path**: A sequence of nodes and edges connecting two nodes.\n",
        "* **Cycle**: A path where the first and last nodes are the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Connected**: A graph is connected if there is a path between every pair of nodes.\n",
        "* **Disconnected**: A graph is disconnected if there is no path between some pair of nodes.\n",
        "* **Complete**: A graph is complete if there is an edge between every pair of nodes.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Acyclic**: A graph is acyclic if it has no cycles.  This means it is a tree or a forest.\n",
        "* **Tree**: A graph is a tree if it is connected and acyclic.  (This also means it will inherently have a single root node.)\n",
